# Deployment image for the AinPath backend (Laravel + Inertia/React).
# Coolify builds this file directly (Dockerfile build pack), which is what lets
# a deploy roll instead of stopping the container first. See DEPLOY.md. This
# file is deployment-only. Local development builds docker/local/Dockerfile via
# docker-compose.local.yml (or runs `composer run dev` outside Docker).

# This line is what makes a deploy rolling, so do not drop it.
#
# Coolify starts the new container, waits for it to report healthy, and only
# then removes the old one. It reads that state two ways: the healthcheck
# configured in the panel, or a HEALTHCHECK found in this file. With neither,
# its wait returns immediately and the old container is removed about 100 ms
# after the new one starts, before php-fpm is listening, which is a real outage
# on every deploy. Keeping it here means the panel toggle cannot take the
# protection away by accident.
#
# It also replaces the base image's own healthcheck, which probes /healthcheck.
# This app does not serve that path, so the container would sit unhealthy and
# Traefik would leave it out of the pool. /up is Laravel's own health route
# (bootstrap/app.php).
